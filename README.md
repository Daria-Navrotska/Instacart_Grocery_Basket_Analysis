# Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository presents a comprehensive exploratory analysis of Instacart’s sales data, aimed at uncovering meaningful customer purchasing behaviors. Acting as an analyst for Instacart, the objective is to generate actionable insights that support the development of targeted marketing strategies.
The analysis explores key questions posed by the sales and marketing teams, such as identifying peak ordering times, understanding customer spending habits, and evaluating product popularity across departments. It also investigates customer segmentation by examining behavioral differences based on brand loyalty, geographic region, age, income level, and family status.
By revealing these patterns, the project equips Instacart with data-driven recommendations to personalize marketing efforts, engage distinct customer groups more effectively, increase sales, and improve the relevance of promotional campaigns.

## Key Questions
- What are the busiest days and hours for orders? When are sales lowest for ad placement?
- At what times do customers spend the most?
- Can products be grouped into simpler price ranges for targeted marketing?
- Which departments have the highest product order frequency?
- How do customer behaviors vary by brand loyalty, region, age, income, and family status?
- What patterns emerge in order frequency, spending, and product preferences across customer segments?
